# Product Stock Listing

Implement simple inventory feature

The attached project is a simple product list page. It has an XML file as its data source and display a list of products and their prices.

We would like to add an inventory (stock) feature to this application. Your tasks are:
•	For each product, below its price, display the message: “n items are in stock”.
•	For each product, add a new field for inventory threshold. If the number of items in stock is below the configured threshold, change the background color to red.
•	Implement the server side method or methods which are required for reducing the inventory when the customer checkouts an order. Which validations are required? What other challenge this method should cope with?

Second feature is Login page. Your tasks are:
•	Add a new login page 
•	Each login should be valid for 2 hours maximum
•	For each user, display last product which was ordered (marked with Green)
•	DB to be used for this feature only is MS SQL DB
